# Thoughts and Notes of Content Development

## Writing Principles

Use [every day words](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/writing-principles-everyday-words?branch=master).

## Article Guidelines

- Be less formal but not less technical.
- Does the heading and introduction tell the reader they're in the right place?
- Keep your article focused on a single idea
- Use indicators to reduce verbosity (Example > instead of Click)
- Make it easy to scan and put the most important things first
- Use supportive tone
- Focus on what matters to the reader, avoid lecturing.
- If the article's date is not recent (stale), customers are less likely to trust the information
