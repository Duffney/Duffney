### Hi there, my name is Josh Duffney ðŸ‘‹

I write for engineers. Having spent a decade in the industry, I [put down my pager and picked up the pen](https://duffney.io/putting-down-the-pager-to-pick-up-the-pen/). My mission is to leverage writing to scale knowledge that's clear, consise, and practical.

At my day job, Iâ€™m a Senior Content Developer @Microsoft where I focus on Ansible, Terraform, PowerShell, DevOps, and Azure.

After writing my first book, I decided to [put down my pager and pick up the pen](https://duffney.io/putting-down-the-pager-to-pick-up-the-pen/). I now spend my work-days writing for doc.microsoft.com. And in my spare time I blog and write a newsletter at [duffney.io](https://duffney.io/newsletter/).

Knowing that my job isn't my career, I seek to master my craft. But without sacrificing my family or performance at work. To do that, I read, research, and implement habits of self-improvement and improved productivity in an endless pursuit of begin better than I was yesterday. ðŸ˜„
