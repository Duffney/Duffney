### Hi there, my name is Josh Duffney ðŸ‘‹

I'm an ex-SRE at Stack Overflow, former Microsoft MVP, Pluralsight author and currently work at Microsoft as a Senior Content Developer.

After writing my first book, I decided to [put down my pager and pick up the pen](https://duffney.io/putting-down-the-pager-to-pick-up-the-pen/). I now spend my work-days writing for doc.microsoft.com. And in my spare time I blog and write a newsletter at [duffney.io](https://duffney.io/newsletter/).

Knowing that my job isn't my career, I seek to master my craft. But without sacrificing my family or performance at work. To do that, I read, research, and implement habits of self-improvement and improved productivity in an endless pursuit of begin better than I was yesterday. ðŸ˜„

**"More hours isn't how you get ahead, your ability to focus is."**
