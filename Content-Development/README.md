# Thoughts and Notes on Content Development

## Writing Principles

1. Focus on the reader
    > What problem is the reader is trying to solve?
2. Write concisely
    * Use an active voice to cut words count
    * Use indicators (Example, `>` instead of `Click`)
    * Use short everyday words
3. Make it easy to scan
    * Make headings descriptive
    * Avoid single word headings

### Rules to Remember

* Focus on a single idea
* Be less formal but not less technical
* Focus on what matters to the reader, remote the rest.
